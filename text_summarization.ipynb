The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

      "Speech:The speech is the departing speech of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, as he completes his five-year tenure in Rashtrapati Bhavan. He expresses gratitude to the people of India, both within the country and abroad, for the opportunity to work with them. He highlights 10 important messages that he has learned during his tenure, which include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Accelerating development\n",
      "* Empowering villages\n",
      "* Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "* Fostering agricultural growth through \"Seed to Food\"\n",
      "* Defeating problems and succeeding\n",
      "* Overcoming problems through partnership\n",
      "* Exhibiting courage in the face of calamities\n",
      "* Creating connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "* Defending the nation\n",
      "* And mobilizing a youth movement for a Developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He then shares a specific anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti, who asked him why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. He appreciated her question and assured her that it was a thoughtful question, and he was committed to working towards making India a developed nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and took it as thoughtful. They assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and that they would work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. The speaker, likely the President of India, reflects on their visit to a village in Nagaland where they saw an empowered village council functioning with financial powers, taking decisions, and producing fruits and vegetables. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering all 600,000 villages in India, providing physical connectivity through quality roads, and connecting them with urban societies. The speech also highlights the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has established a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex in 65 villages, providing health care, education, and vocational training, leading to large-scale employment generation and entrepreneurship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs in a village. The project has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in activities such as farming, power generation, and food processing. The project has also partnered with experts from Japan to develop 55 internationally competitive products, enhancing the innovative abilities of the villagers. The speaker believes that this model can be replicated across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with an estimated need of 7000 such projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. The speaker is confident that the partnership between farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "2. Meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who has remained optimistic and confident. Despite his disability, he expressed a desire to sing in front of the speaker. The speaker is moved by his story and the importance of confidence, training, and help he received from others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with the message to \"Defeat the problems and succeed\", suggesting that even in the face of adversity, one can overcome challenges and achieve their goals with the right mindset and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about the author's inspiring experiences with two individuals: a person with physical challenges who has a hidden talent for music, and the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the 2005 earthquake. The author emphasizes the importance of positive attitude, perseverance, and partnership in overcoming challenges. The speech conveys the message that despite physical or environmental obstacles, people can still achieve greatness with the right mindset and support from others. The author highlights the resilience of the people of Urusa village, who, despite their losses, were able to overcome their challenges and even give back to their community.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The author describes visiting a village affected by an earthquake and seeing children and villagers working together to rebuild and recover. They also recall a visit to the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 Tsunami, where they were touched by the courage and generosity of the islanders who had taken in affected victims as their own. The author also references a poem they wrote, \"Sea Waves\", which celebrates the courage and determination of the islanders. The speech concludes with a mention of the author's address to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, where they discussed the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a project that would connect all 53 African countries with satellite, fiber optic, and wireless networks at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. A pilot project in Ethiopia has already been commissioned, with Indian and African universities and hospitals involved. For example, the Indira Gandhi National Open University is offering an MBA course to Ethiopian students, and specialists from India's CARE Hospital are providing telemedicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by the Prime Minister of India, highlighting several achievements and initiatives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Telemedicine: The Prime Minister mentions that India is providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, since November 2006, demonstrating India's technological capabilities in healthcare.\n",
      "2. National Pride: The Prime Minister expresses pride in India's defense forces, highlighting their bravery and dedication to duty, even in challenging circumstances. He mentions his experiences visiting various military installations, presenting colors to regiments, and interacting with troops.\n",
      "3. Para-military forces: The Prime Minister also acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces, central and state police personnel, and internal security forces in maintaining the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches upon the Prime Minister's interaction with the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which aims to transform Indian youth into enlightened citizens. However, the details of this initiative are not provided in the given speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, specifically in the Medak district. The speaker highlights the positive impact of the training, including self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and recognition of duties towards the nation. They share a personal anecdote about a student leader who helped her father quit smoking after attending the Lead India Training Camp. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of empowering India's 540 million youth below the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and civilizational heritage while pursuing economic growth. The speaker believes that it is the duty of the current generation to preserve these treasures for future generations. India has made significant progress in the last 60 years and has the potential to become a developed nation by 2020. The speaker encourages the youth to aim high and is optimistic that they will achieve their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker outlines five key goals for realizing India's vision of a developed nation by 2020:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reducing the rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Ensuring equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Developing a harmonious relationship between agriculture, industry, and the service sector\n",
      "4. Providing education with a value system to all meritorious students, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. Attracting the world's most talented scholars, scientists, and investors to make India the best destination for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech concludes with a quote from a famous poem, emphasizing the idea that if you aim high, your dreams will come true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech outlines a vision for a nation that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Provides the best healthcare to all citizens\n",
      "* Has a responsive, transparent, and corruption-free government\n",
      "* Eradicates poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children\n",
      "* Fosters a sense of belonging and inclusivity for all citizens\n",
      "* Achieves sustainable growth and prosperity, with a focus on physical and emotional well-being, security, peace, and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, and is a heartfelt address to the citizens of India. He expresses his gratitude to the people for their love and support over the past five years and acknowledges India as one of the best places to live in, with a proud leadership. He then shares his mission to connect the hearts and minds of the Indian people, promoting self-confidence and unity, and vows to continue working towards making India a developed nation by 2020.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam delivered a departing speech after completing 5 years as President of India, sharing 10 key messages from his experiences. He emphasized the importance of accelerating development, empowering villages, and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. During his speech, he highlighted specific instances, including a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. Dr. Kalam appreciated the question, acknowledging it as a thoughtful one, and assured Anukriti that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, where they would work towards making it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also shared his experiences and observations during his visits to various parts of the country. For instance, he recalled his visit to Nagaland, where he saw a prosperous village with empowered village council members functioning with financial powers and taking decisions. He emphasized the need for providing physical connectivity through quality roads for enabling faster movement of products from villages to the market, highlighting the potential for transformation in the 600,000 villages of India if they are empowered to deal with their development and well-connected among themselves and with urban societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam also spoke about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore, which has established a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. The complex provides three connectivities - physical, electronic, and knowledge - leading to economic connectivity, and has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of numerous entrepreneurs with active support from the government, civil society, and 1000 self-help groups. The project has also transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, enabling villagers to cultivate Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, generate power using biomass, process food, and run marketing centers, providing a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Dr. Kalam mentioned that during the last eight months, the people of Periyar PURA villages, technologically supported by Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, have worked with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, developing internationally competitive prototypes for 55 life-style products with support from JETRO specialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This cooperative venture has enhanced the innovative ability of the people, enabling them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products. Dr. Kalam emphasized that similar PURA initiatives are being established in many states, and that the whole country needs around 7000 PURA to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Dr. Kalam shared his enriching experiences with farmers and agricultural scientists, emphasizing the importance of \"Seed to Food\" and empowering farmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for a second green revolution. He also highlighted the potential for increasing agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships among farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam also spoke about the importance of courage in combating calamities, citing his own experiences during the 2004 Tsunami and the 2005 earthquake in Jammu & Kashmir. He shared the story of Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who despite having no hands and legs, had a radiant face and a happy state of mind, and emphasized the importance of perseverance and overcoming challenges. Dr. Kalam also shared two personal anecdotes about people who have overcome physical challenges to achieve their goals, highlighting the potential for success and making a positive impact.\n",
